  This document describes the REST web service interface to the Teleroute
  freight exchange service. A REST API is a way to programmatically transfer
  information over the web using a predefined schema. REST was developed by the
  World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) based on a W3C standard: HTTP.


  The interface is designed to make Teleroute Freight Exchange integration
  easier for TMS/FMS developers. It provides secured access in JSON format to
  the main functions (CRUD) of the Teleroute freight exchange service.
