  The Freight Exchange endpoints make use of JWT ([JSON Web
  Tokens](https://jwt.io/)) for secure authentication and authorization. This
  token is to be provided in the Authorization header of each HTTP request using
  the '[Bearer'](https://oauth.net/2/bearer-tokens/) scheme.


  In order to use the Freight Exchange APIâ€™s you need a business account with
  proper access. If you do not have your credentials, please address to
  Teleroute Integration team.
